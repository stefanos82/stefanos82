- 👋 Hi, I'm @stefanos82
- 👀 I'm interested in solving problems, whatever that it might be.
- 🌱 I'm currently re-learning C++ (C++11 up to C++23), but also I have the time to enjoy other languages and learn new tools as well.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on interesting projects that could teach me important lessons and help me acquire expertise in new areas.
