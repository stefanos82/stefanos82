## Hi, I'm @stefanos82

- I've worked as **Network Engineer**, **Systems Administrator**, **Tech
  Support**, **Wed Developer**, **R&D**.
- I'm interested in **programming languages**, **compilers**, **solving
  problems**, and **learning new tools**.
- I like learning new things, **acquiring new knowledge**, and **gaining
  experience** all the time.
- I've got my hands dirty with multiple programming languages and
  various **frameworks** of all sorts.

  others, but still I can deliver) be it programming languages or web
