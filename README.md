- 👋 Hi, I'm @stefanos82
- 👀 I'm interested in solving problems, whatever that it might be.
- 🌱 I'm currently re-learning C++ (a.k.a. modern C++), but I also enjoy other languages and tools as well.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on interesting projects that could teach me important lessons and help me acquire expertise in new areas.
